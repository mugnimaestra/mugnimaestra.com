# Hello, World!

Welcome to my blog! This is a sample post written in MDX format. MDX allows us to use React-style components right inside our markdown content.

## Features

- Write content in Markdown
- Use components when needed
- Code syntax highlighting

```typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```
